# If youâ€™ve already logged into your machine and open a new terminal window
# (xterm) then '.bashrc' is executed before the window command prompt. It is
# also run when you start a new bash instance in the terminal.
#
# Note that this file loads before '.bashrc' on macOS.

# On macOS, the terminal by default runs a login shell every time, so this is a
# little different to most other systems, but you can configure that in the
