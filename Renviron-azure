# R environment for Azure VM



# Dynamic linker/loader configuration
#
# Ensure `dyn.load()` is configured correctly.
# This step is needed to ensure hdf5r loads correctly, for example.
#
# Since we have sudo access, dDefine lib paths in `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/`.
# 
# Add one path per file:
# - local.conf:        /usr/local/lib
# - local-x86_64.conf: /usr/local/lib64
#
# If you install new software (e.g. gsl, hdf5) need to update config.
# Run `sudo ldconfig`.
#
# Check the linkage using `ldd`.
# For example:
# ldd /usr/local/bin/emacs
#
# On systems without sudo access, `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` can be exported per user
# in `.shrc` file instead. Configuration via `ld.so.conf.d` approach is better.

# Only set `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` when you don't have sudo access.
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib64:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib64/R/lib:/usr/lib64:/usr/lib:/lib64:/lib"



# Restrict `$PATH` so we don't load any binaries from conda or bcbio.
PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
